First, in iOS 6 Apple started running the accelerometer all day with it’s “raise to speak to Siri” feature - (simply put the phone to your ear to activate Siri). Now with iOS 7, Apple has introduced a “constant on” gyroscope, with the introduction of the Parallax effect. Apple can measure “stay” events when the iPhone is not moving without resorting to expensive \/ inaccurate geo fencing. Why am I so sure that this is what Apple is doing? Apple was originally planning to go even further by providing step count data (similar to the Galaxy S4’s S Health data) to developers. This is only possible by running the aforementioned sensors and using signal processing. This was shown in the new iOS 7 technologies during the keynote and even in the iOS 7 beta 1 documentation, but all mentions were abruptly removed with beta 2 and beyond.
