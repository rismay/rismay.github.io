However, the technology to passively capture those experiences really didn’t exist at the time. Back in August 2011 the world was in a very different place. The Facebook Timeline did not exist. GPS tracking was just being used to monitor workouts. Uber was just getting started. Geo fencing had not yet entered the vernacular.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"I think that the quantified self movement needs to embrace passive monitoring technologies in order to truly become mainstream. Without automating the monotony of capturing life’s seemingly irrelevant moments the quantified self movement simply won’t get past the “data dessert.” However, wrkstrm wants to go beyond that and turn this data into art in the same way that Jer Thorp and Nicholas Felton are demonstrating is possible.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Today, the competition is very different.
