I can’t remember the last time I had an experience like this. This seems like an iPhone moment. The entire Notion environment and related ecosystem is very easy to use.

I don’t think Notion would have gotten here without React Native. Yet as a native developer, I don’t like it.

Then again, have we reached the uncanny valley of web development? Will we be there in 2 years, 5 years? At that point will native have advantages?"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Using Notion raises as many questions as it answers.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"}],"kind":"content"}],"kind":"article","hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/me.rismay.site\/documentation\/rismay-me","doc:\/\/me.rismay.site\/documentation\/Rismay\/blog"]]},"metadata":{"roleHeading":"Article","title":"Whoa…","role":"article"},"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/me.rismay.site\/documentation\/Rismay\/whoa","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"references":{"doc://me.rismay.site/documentation/Rismay/blog":{"kind":"article","role":"article","images":[{"identifier":"rismay-me-blog-icon.svg","type":"icon"},{"type":"card","identifier":"rismay-me-blog-card.svg"}],"title":"Blog","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/rismay\/blog","abstract":[{"text":"Thoughts, tutorials, and retrospective on engineering.","type":"text"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/me.rismay.site\/documentation\/Rismay\/blog"},"doc://me.rismay.site/documentation/Rismay/navigating-the-performance-penalties-of-swift-type-inference":{"url":"\/documentation\/rismay\/navigating-the-performance-penalties-of-swift-type-inference","type":"topic","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"In the world of programming languages, Swift has emerged as a dynamic and versatile option.
