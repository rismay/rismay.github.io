Why I chose postach.io after weighing blogging options and wanting a low-friction workflow.

I have been meaning to start a blog containing my thoughts on technology - particularly the thought process behind the wrkstrm concept. However, I was really stumped when it came to finding the correct platform. There are so many options to chose from! For me, it was a classic "Paradox of Choice" problem. Blogging options range from the complex:

To the simple:

[How about just starting a tumblr?](http://mailboxapp.tumblr.com/)

or the techie:

[A Jekyll blog from my GitHub account?](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)

I knew that I wanted my blog to center around a tool I use almost everyday. Both github and EC2 met that criteria. However, these tools were just not user friendly.

Then came [postach.io](http://postach.io). Now, I can blog with minimal friction.

“Friction" is what this blog is going to be about. Technology should get out of our way so that we can focus on what matters to us. Products like twitter and Moves are great "minimal friction" environments. However, in the Quantified Self movement products like Moves and Evernote are exceptions to the rule. Generally the thinking behind each product is so new that most of the effort is simply spent on turning a new idea into an actual "thing."

This is where concepts like wrkstrm step in. I started conceptualizing wrkstrm back in August 2011 as an evernote while I was stuck on the subway with no internet access. Originally, I thought wrkstrm would be a tool to learn about people's prior experiences. However, the technology to passively capture those experiences really didn't exist at the time. Back in August 2011 the world was in a very different place. The Facebook Timeline did not exist. GPS tracking was just being used to monitor workouts. Uber was just getting started. Geo fencing had not yet entered the vernacular.

I think that the quantified self movement needs to embrace passive monitoring technologies in order to truly become mainstream. Without automating the monotony of capturing life's seemingly irrelevant moments the quantified self movement simply won't get past the "data dessert." However, wrkstrm wants to go beyond that and turn this data into art in the same way that Jer Thorp and Nicholas Felton are demonstrating is possible.

Today, the competition is very different. Companies like protogeo have essentially nailed the original wrkstrm experience. It seems like there are at least 3 teams at each hackathon pitching passive location monitoring. It is time to move on and remove friction from another aspect of life.

Stay tuned.
