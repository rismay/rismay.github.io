## Intent

Layouts should feel calm, readable, and IDE-like, with clear navigation and
focused content.

## Grid

- Base spacing scale: 4/8/12/16/24/32/48.
- Content columns centered with generous margins.
- Dense views should not drop below 8pt row height.

## Layout patterns

- Left navigation for library and bookmarks.
- Primary content column for reading and exercises.
- Right inspector for notes, progress, and details.

## Do

- Maintain consistent spacing between sections.
- Use dividers sparingly to separate major regions.

## Avoid

- Overcrowded panels that reduce reading focus.
- Inconsistent padding between similar components.
