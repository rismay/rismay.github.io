## Intent

The logo should convey speed, clarity, and focus without feeling aggressive.

## Primary mark

- Use the primary logo for product headers and launch screens.
- Maintain clear space equal to the height of the mark.

## Secondary marks

- Use monochrome marks for compact surfaces.
- Avoid stacking marks unless required by layout.

## Do

- Use SVG assets wherever possible.
- Keep high contrast between logo and background.

## Avoid

- Distorting proportions or rotating the mark.
- Placing the logo over noisy gradients.
