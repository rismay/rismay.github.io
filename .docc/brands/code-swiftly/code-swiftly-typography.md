## Intent

Typography should feel friendly and technical, prioritizing long-form reading
and code clarity.

## Families

- Headings: SF Pro Display (fallback: SF Pro Text, system)
- Body: SF Pro Text (fallback: system)
- Code: SF Mono (fallback: Menlo, monospace)

## Scale and hierarchy

- H1: 32-36pt
- H2: 24-28pt
- H3: 20-22pt
- Body: 15-17pt
- Caption: 12-13pt

## Usage rules

- Keep headings concise; avoid all-caps.
- Use medium weight for navigation labels.
- Code blocks use monospaced fonts with ligatures disabled.

## Do

- Keep line length between 60-90 characters.
- Use generous line height for reading.

## Avoid

- Dense text blocks without spacing.
- Mixing more than two weights on a single screen.
