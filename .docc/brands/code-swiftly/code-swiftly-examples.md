## Purpose

Concrete do/don't examples for applying the CodeSwiftly brand in docs and UI.

## Do

- Use the primary blue for a single key CTA per screen.
- Keep reading surfaces neutral with high-contrast text.
- Use consistent spacing and predictable grid rhythm.

## Avoid

- Multiple competing blue accents on the same view.
- Dense layouts that reduce readability.
- Low-contrast text on colored surfaces.

## Sample layouts

- Reader: left library sidebar, centered content, optional right inspector.
- Exercise: editor and results split, diagnostics inline with code.
- Book: table of contents and chapter view with citation markers.

## Code samples

- Use monospaced blocks with clear boundaries.
- Prefer short, focused snippets with explicit titles.
