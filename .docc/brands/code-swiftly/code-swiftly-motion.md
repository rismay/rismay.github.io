## Intent

Motion should signal focus changes and learning progress without distraction.

## Rules

- Subtle transitions (200-250ms) for panels and drawers.
- Use progress animations only when state changes.
- Honor reduce-motion preferences by disabling non-essential animation.

## Do

- Use motion to reinforce navigation changes.
- Keep animations short and consistent.

## Avoid

- Looping or decorative animations in reading views.
- Simultaneous animations across multiple panels.
