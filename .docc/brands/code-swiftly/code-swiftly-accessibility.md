## Intent

Accessibility is mandatory for reading and learning workflows.

## Requirements

- Contrast ratio >= 4.5 for body text and controls.
- Keyboard-first navigation for reading and exercises.
- Visible focus states using accent blue.
- Reduce-motion preference disables non-essential animation.

## Do

- Provide readable font sizes and generous line height.
- Use clear labels for interactive elements.

## Avoid

- Relying on color alone to convey status.
- Small hit targets in navigation or inspectors.
