## Project Title

CommonSwift Brand Identity

## Background

The "CommonSwift" ecosystem is a collection of Swift libraries designed to provide a consistent and modern toolchain for developers. These libraries cover a wide range of functionalities, from low-level shell interaction (`CommonShell`) to command-line interface creation (`CommonCLI`) and more. The brand identity should reflect the core principles of the CommonSwift ecosystem and be versatile enough to be used across all libraries.

## Objectives

-   Create a recognizable and versatile brand identity for the CommonSwift ecosystem.
-   Design a primary SVG logo and a set of pictographs (which I'm interpreting from "philographs") representing the core libraries and concepts.
-   Establish a clear and modern visual style that can be applied to documentation, websites, and other materials.

## Target Audience

-   Swift developers who use or contribute to the CommonSwift libraries.
-   The audience values well-designed, robust, and easy-to-use tools.

## Key Message/Theme

"Building blocks for modern Swift development."
The brand should convey:
-   **Safety:** Robust and reliable tools.
-   **Speed:** Efficient and performant libraries.
-   **Expressiveness:** Modern and elegant APIs.
-   **Modularity:** A collection of independent yet interoperable components.

## Deliverables

1.  **Primary Logo:** An SVG logo for "CommonSwift".
2.  **Pictographs/Icons:** A set of SVG icons representing the core libraries and concepts, such as:
    -   `CommonShell`
    -   `CommonCLI`
    -   `CommonProcess`
    -   `DoccStencil`
    -   And others as they are identified.
3.  **Color Palette:** A primary and secondary color palette.
4.  **Typography Guidelines:** Recommendations for fonts to be used in documentation.

## Tone & Style

-   **Modern:** Clean lines, simple shapes, and a minimalist aesthetic.
-   **Geometric:** Use of basic geometric shapes to create a sense of order and structure.
-   **Friendly and approachable:** The design should not be intimidating to new users.

## Constraints/Mandatories

-   All assets must be in SVG format.
-   The design must be versatile enough to work in both light and dark mode.

## Next Steps

1.  Design the primary logo for CommonSwift.
2.  Design the pictographs for the core libraries.
3.  Refine the color palette and typography guidelines.
4.  Add all assets to the `Resources` directory of this DocC bundle.
