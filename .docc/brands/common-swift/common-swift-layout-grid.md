## Intent

Layouts should feel calm and predictable, optimized for reading and scanning.

## Grid

- Base spacing scale: 4/8/12/16/24/32/48.
- Use generous margins on long-form pages.
- Dense views should never drop below 8pt row height.

## Layout patterns

- Primary content column centered with wide margins.
- Left navigation for libraries and sections.
- Right inspector only when needed for metadata.

## Do

- Maintain consistent spacing between sections.
- Use dividers sparingly to separate large regions.

## Avoid

- Excessively tight layouts that reduce readability.
- Inconsistent padding between similar components.
