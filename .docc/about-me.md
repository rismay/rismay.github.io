Background, philosophy, and experience.

## The Story

I build calm, opinionated software systems that help teams deliver business
objectives faster without losing craft. My work is grounded in Apple platforms
and increasingly wherever Swift runs. My path started with design and systems
thinking, then grew into shipping developer platforms, automation workflows,
and documentation that scale across teams. I care about the details that make a
product feel humane: language, pacing, and the invisible scaffolding that keeps
quality consistent.

Today I lead with a dual lens: product clarity and technical rigor. I invest in
type-safe tooling, explicit process, and documentation that tells the real
story, not just the API surface. This shows up in my work on CLIA agents, DocC
systems, and CommonShell/CommonProcess conventions that help teams execute
reliably without losing their voice.

I believe good systems make space for curiosity. That is why I focus on small,
frequent releases and feedback loops that measure learning, not just output. I
use constraints intentionally: shared vocabularies, consistent navigation, and
visual systems that emphasize what matters and reduce noise.

If there is a through line, it is this: make complex work feel simple without
flattening it. I build the scaffolding, write the story, and keep the bar high
so teams can move fast with confidence.
