Starting a switch to a more capable all-in-one productivity tool.

Tags: Atom, Blog, Daily, Evernote, imdone

Today is the first day of my switch to a more capable all-in-one productivity tool! I feel like I have tried so many things yet so few have stuck. I hope this one does!

First, I tried [Evernote](http://evernote.com). It did a lot for me. However, it got convoluted. The first hint that this solution was doomed was the bad reminders functionality. The second was the never updated penultimate support. To this day, the drawing just does not feel natural. 

Then, I tried [Atom](http://atom.io). It was shiny and new. However, when I think about the reason of why I started it (to use git as a task database), that never paid off. Mainly, the goal was learning git while using it as my note taking system.

Then, I tried the imdone [atom extension](https://atom.io/packages/imdone-atom) and [mac app](https://imdone.io). It has worked for me for the better part of 4 years! It was great for the kanban view but I was trying to hack a productivity system out of text. I did this semi consistently, but the friction of keeping it up to date has been hard. You have to sync every computer you use manually via push and pull. You need Atom. You Need the Mac app. Resolve conflicts. Add metadata by hand. The system was falling apart at the seams... 

Hopefully, Notion does all of this. From what I heard, it enables the second brain method. It also allows for you to get all areas of your life together into one place. This was the goal behind [wrkstrm.me](http://www.wrkstrm.me/home), a concept I had about 9 years ago. I never fleshed it out  because I wanted to get professional iOS experience instead, but the concept has always been at the back of my mind. 

I wish the Notion team the best of luck.
