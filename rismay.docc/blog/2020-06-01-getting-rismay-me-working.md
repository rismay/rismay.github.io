Setting up rismay.me with Fruition and reflecting on the return to blogging.

A big OMG moment this week has been setting up cloudflare workers with [fruitionsite.com](http://fruitionsite.com). This feels right for the [rismay.me](http://rismay.me) blog! It's my personal internet space and process of me writing to publishing should be as quick as possible. However, it is crazy how similar it is to [postach.io](http://postach.io), a blog I started in 2013! The web works in both fast and slow ways. The feeling of deja-vu is here and I'm feeling old. In fact, the initial content for my blog will come from those original posts.

After another week of exploration, the notion community continues to impress. Notion has this uncanny ability to be really simple to setup but hard to master. But not really hard, just sufficiently hard. In fact this is a common gaming pattern! Every level of understanding the product creates a sense of accomplishment. Small "Aha!" moments littered throughout the way. They even out right use gamification by giving users credits in order to get to know their product.
