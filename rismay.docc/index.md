An engineer and designer building developer experience, creative systems, and human-centered tools.

## Overview

I build calm, opinionated software that helps teams move faster without losing craft. My work blends
product engineering, design systems, and automation, with a focus on tools that make complex work
feel simple.

If you are looking for a thoughtful builder who cares about polish, clarity, and velocity, you are
in the right place.

Workstreams are how I organize the work: each stream is a living set of products, tools, writing,
and visual systems that reinforce a shared mission.

## What I Do

- **Developer experience:** design and ship CLIs, platforms, and workflows that reduce friction.
- **Product systems:** craft reusable foundations for fast, consistent product delivery.
- **Creative tooling:** bridge engineering and design with tools that make good taste scalable.

## Selected Work

- <doc:projects> for highlighted products, systems, and experiments.
- <doc:workstreams> for workstreams and identity systems across the portfolio.

## Writing

I share process notes, technical learnings, and product thinking in the blog.

## Collaborate

Open to focused consulting, product design engineering, and tooling partnerships.
